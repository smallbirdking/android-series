The series was cancelled after its first season, but a special based on the series titled \"The Super Dave Superbowl of Knowledge\" aired on January 29, 1994.\n\nThe show starred and was based on the comedy of Bob Einstein and his Super Dave Osborne persona. Both Bob Einstein and Art Irizawa provided the voices for Super Dave and his assistant, Fuji Hakahito, and also appeared as their characters in live-action skits which ended each episode.\n\nHalfway through the show's initial run, Irizawa was asked to modify his voice for Fuji, following complaints to Fox from Asian-American groups that the character was an offensive stereotype. Irizawa subsequently re-recorded his dialogue for all of the show's episodes.\n\nAt present, DIC has no plans to release the show on home video.","origin_country":["US"],"poster_path":"/pvARdZ0wbUtCz3jG1HfDjqv4xT9.jpg","popularity":1.027,"name":"Super Dave: Daredevil for Hire","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0},{"backdrop_path":"/3SPufNVaUg53fDod87iNjPnkkIb.jpg","first_air_date":"2009-09-14","genre_ids":[99],"id":35124,"original_language":"en","original_name":"Daredevils","overview":null,"origin_country":["GB"],"poster_path":null,"popularity":1.005946,"name":"Daredevils","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0},{"backdrop_path":null,"first_air_date":"2006-05-03","genre_ids":[],"id":23624,"original_language":"en","original_name":"Celebrity Daredevils","overview":"","origin_country":["GB"],"poster_path":null,"popularity":0.002606,"name":"Celebrity Daredevils","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0}]
